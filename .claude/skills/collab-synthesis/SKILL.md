# Collab-Synthesis — Synthesis & Fusion Document Generator

Build synthesis documents from existing source documents. Three execution modes: **solo** (one agent reads everything and writes), **team** (2-3 specialists deliberate, designated writer synthesizes), or **workshop** (exactly 2 agents iterate on a single running document for N rounds). Five document types: **solo** (one agent synthesizes raw docs), **team** (multi-agent deliberation), **master** (rollup of sub-sessions within one session — e.g., 30Aa + 30Ab + 30Ba → Session 30 master), **fusion** (synthesis of syntheses — source docs are themselves synthesis documents, producing cross-synthesis discoveries), **workshop** (iterative 2-agent cross-pollination with labeled sections, forced engagement, convergence/dissent tracking). Detects execution mode from `--agent` (singular) vs `--agents` (plural). Detects document type from context or `--type` override.

## Usage

## Phase 0: Parse & Validate

### 0a. Extract Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

| Arg | Required | Default | Description |
|:----|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `<doc1> [doc2 ...]` | YES (at least 1) | — | Source document paths (positional, before any flags) |
| `--agent <type>` | ONE OF | — | Single agent type → **solo mode** |
| `--agents <t1,t2,...>` | THESE TWO | — | Comma-separated agent types → **team or workshop mode** |
| `--writer <name>` | no | see defaults | Who writes the final document (not used in workshop) |
| `--output <path>` | no | auto-detect | Output file path |
| `--type <type>` | no | auto-detect | Document format: `solo`, `team`, `master`, `fusion`, `workshop` |
| `--session <id>` | no | auto-detect | Session identifier (e.g., `29`, `30Ba`) |
| `--rounds <N>` | no | 2 | Number of iteration rounds (**workshop only**) |
| `--dry-run` | no | false | Show plan without spawning |

### 0b. Mode Detection

- `--agent` present → **solo mode**
- `--agents` present + `--type workshop` → **workshop mode**
- `--agents` present (no workshop type) → **team mode**
- Both `--agent` AND `--agents` present → error: "Use --agent (solo) OR --agents (team/workshop), not both."
- Neither present → error: show usage.

### 0c. Validate Source Documents

Read 1 line of each source document to verify it exists. If any missing, report which and stop.

### 0d. Validate Agent Types

Check that all agent types exist in `.claude/agents/`. Valid types:

```
baptista-spacetime-analyst, berry-geometric-phase-theorist, connes-ncg-theorist,
coordinator, cosmic-web-theorist, dirac-antimatter-theorist, einstein-theorist,
feynman-theorist, gen-physicist, hawking-theorist, kaluza-klein-theorist,
knowledge-weaver, landau-condensed-matter-theorist, little-red-dots-jwst-analyst,
nazarewicz-nuclear-structure-theorist, neutrino-detection-specialist,
paasch-mass-quantization-analyst, phonon-exflation-sim,
quantum-acoustics-theorist, sagan-empiricist, schwarzschild-penrose-geometer,
spectral-geometer, tesla-resonance, web-researcher
```

If invalid, list available types and stop.

### 0e. Defaults

**Writer defaults:**
- Solo mode: the single agent writes the output (no separate writer needed)
- Team mode: `coordinator` if present in `--agents`, otherwise the FIRST agent listed
- Workshop mode: no designated writer — both agents write to the same document sequentially

**Type defaults:**
- Solo execution + raw docs (gate verdicts, computation output, minutes): `solo`
- Solo execution + sub-session syntheses as input: `master`
- Team execution with 2 agents: `team`
- Team execution with 3+ agents OR source docs are themselves syntheses: `fusion`
- `--type workshop` explicitly set: `workshop`
- Override with `--type` always respected

**Type selection heuristic** (when `--type` not provided):
1. If `--type workshop` is explicitly set → `workshop`
2. If ALL source docs match `*-synthesis.md` or `*-synth.md` → default `fusion` (synthesis-of-syntheses)
3. If source docs are from the SAME session number (e.g., all `session-30*`) and execution is solo → default `master` (sub-session rollup)
4. If team execution → default `team` (2 agents) or `fusion` (3 agents)
5. Otherwise → default `solo`

**NOTE**: Workshop mode is NEVER auto-detected — it must be explicitly requested via `--type workshop`. This prevents accidental workshop launches when team mode was intended.

**Output path default** (if `--output` not provided):
1. If `--session` provided: `sessions/session-{N}/session-{session-id}-{type-suffix}.md`
   - `solo` → `-synthesis.md`
   - `team` → `-team-synthesis.md`
   - `master` → `-master-synthesis.md` (rolls up sub-sessions within one session)
   - `fusion` → `-fusion-synthesis.md` (synthesis of syntheses)
   - `workshop` → `-{agentA-short}-{agentB-short}-workshop.md` (e.g., `session-34-nazarewicz-tesla-workshop.md`)
2. If no `--session`: attempt to extract session from first source doc filename (regex: `session-(\d+\w*)`). If found, use that session folder.
3. If neither works: ask the user for the output path.

**Session ID default** (if `--session` not provided):
- Extract from first source doc filename. If ambiguous or not found, ask.

**Rounds default** (if `--rounds` not provided):
- Workshop mode: 2 rounds
- Non-workshop modes: `--rounds` is ignored with a warning if provided

### 0f. Mode-Specific Constraints

**Team mode:**
- Max 3 agents (CLAUDE.md mandate). If more provided, warn and stop.
- If `coordinator` is not in the `--agents` list, add it automatically and inform the user.
- If `--writer` names an agent not in `--agents`, error and stop.

**Workshop mode:**
- EXACTLY 2 agents required. If more or fewer provided, error: "Workshop mode requires exactly 2 agents. Got {N}."
- No coordinator added — workshop is a direct 2-agent exchange with no mediator.
- `--writer` is ignored with a warning if provided (both agents write to the same document).
- `--rounds` must be >= 1 and <= 5. Default: 2.

---

## Phase 1: Collision Check

If the output file already exists, use AskUserQuestion:
- "Output file already exists at {path}. Overwrite / Choose new name / Cancel?"

---

## Phase 2: Dry Run (if `--dry-run`)

Display plan and stop. Format varies by type:

**Solo/Master/Fusion/Team:**
```
=== COLLAB-SYNTHESIS DRY RUN ===

Mode: {solo|team}
Type: {solo|team|master|fusion}
       solo   = one agent synthesizes raw docs
       team   = multi-agent deliberation
       master = rollup of sub-sessions within one session
       fusion = synthesis of syntheses (source docs are themselves syntheses)
Session: {id}

Source Documents ({N}):
  1. {path} ({lines} lines)
  2. {path} ({lines} lines)
  ...

Agent(s): {list with types}
Writer: {name}
Output: {path}

Ready to {spawn agent | create team}. Run without --dry-run to proceed.
```

**Workshop:**
```
=== COLLAB-SYNTHESIS DRY RUN (WORKSHOP) ===

Type: workshop (iterative 2-agent cross-pollination)
Session: {id}
Rounds: {N} ({N*2} total turns)

Source Documents ({N}):
  1. {path} ({lines} lines)
  2. {path} ({lines} lines)
  ...

Agent A: {short-name-A} ({agent-type-A}) — opens each round
Agent B: {short-name-B} ({agent-type-B}) — responds each round

Execution Plan:
  R1-A: {short-name-A} reads sources, writes opening analysis
  R1-B: {short-name-B} reads sources + R1-A, writes response & cross-synthesis
  R2-A: {short-name-A} reads R1-A + R1-B, writes follow-up (convergence/dissent)
  R2-B: {short-name-B} reads all, writes convergence summary + verdict table
  ...

Infrastructure: NONE (no TeamCreate, no inbox, pure sequential Agent calls)
Output: {path}

Ready to begin workshop. Run without --dry-run to proceed.
```

---

## Phase 3: Execute (branches by mode)

### SOLO MODE

Spawn a **single background agent** (NOT a team) using the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: from `--agent`
- `run_in_background`: true
- `name`: `synthesis-writer`

**Solo Agent Prompt** (varies by `--type`):

#### Type: `solo`

```
You are writing a **session synthesis** from raw source documents for the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project. Your source documents are computation output, gate verdicts, meeting minutes, or other primary materials — NOT other syntheses.

## Your Task

Read all source documents, then write a synthesis to: `{output_path}`

## Source Documents (read ALL of these FIRST)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)
- MEMORY.md: `~\.claude\projects\C--sandbox-rclab-exflation\memory\MEMORY.md`

## Document Structure (follow this format)

```markdown
# Session {session-id} Synthesis: {Title — derive from source content}

**Date**: {today}
**Session type**: SYNTHESIS
**Agents**: {your agent type} (solo synthesis)
**Source documents**: {list}

---

## I. Session Outcome

{2-3 sentence verdict. Lead with the most consequential result. State whether gates passed or failed.}

---

## II. Gate Verdicts (Summary)

{If source docs contain gate verdicts, tabulate them:}

| Gate | Type | Verdict | Decisive Number |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:----------------|

{If no gates in source docs, replace with "## II. Key Results" and summarize findings.}

---

## III. Computation Results

{For each computation or major finding in the source docs, one subsection:}

### {Result Title}

**Result**: {the number, then the classification}

{2-3 paragraphs: what was computed, what it means, structural implications}

---

## IV. Structural Implications

{What these results mean for the framework. Update constraint map if applicable. Identify what opened, what closed, what shifted.}

---

## V. Forward Projection

{What should happen next. Specific computations. Which gates are now decisive. What the results enable or block.}

---

## VI. Probability Assessment

{ONLY if you are sagan-empiricist or if source docs contain probability updates. Otherwise omit this section.}

{If included: prior, likelihood ratios, posterior. Show the math.}
```

## Rules
- Ground in the SOURCE DOCUMENTS. Do not invent results not in the sources.
- Report numbers first. Classify second. Interpret third.
- Gate verdicts from source docs are authoritative — do not re-adjudicate.
- If sources conflict, flag the conflict explicitly.
- Write ONLY the output file. Nothing else.
```

#### Type: `master`

```
You are writing a **master synthesis** for the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project — a rollup of all sub-sessions within a single session number. Your source documents are sub-session syntheses (e.g., 30Aa, 30Ab, 30Ba) and you integrate them into one definitive session-level document (e.g., "Session 30 Master Synthesis"). This is a synthesis of sub-sessions, organized by importance not chronology.

## Your Task

Read all source documents, then write a master synthesis to: `{output_path}`

## Source Documents (read ALL of these FIRST)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)
- MEMORY.md: `~\.claude\projects\C--sandbox-rclab-exflation\memory\MEMORY.md`

## Document Structure

```markdown
# Session {session-id} Master Synthesis: {Title}

**Date**: {today}
**Sub-sessions rolled up**: {list of sub-sessions, e.g., 30Aa, 30Ab, 30Ba, 30Bb}
**Agents**: {from each sub-session}
**Document type**: Definitive standalone session record — all sub-session results integrated by importance, not chronology

---

## Executive Summary

{3-5 paragraphs. The reader should be able to understand the entire session arc from this section alone. State: what was attempted, what was found, what it means, what's next.}

---

## I. Results Hierarchy

{Organize ALL results from ALL sub-sessions by importance, not chronology:}

### Tier 1: Framework-Decisive Results
{Results that change the framework's status, probability, or direction}

### Tier 2: Structural Results
{Permanent mathematical results, theorems, proven identities}

### Tier 3: Diagnostic Results
{Useful numbers that inform future sessions but don't independently change status}

---

## II. Gate Verdicts (Complete)

| Gate | Sub-Session | Type | Verdict | Decisive Number |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:----------------|

---

## III. Constraint Map Update

{What opened, what closed, what shifted. Reference specific gate IDs.}

---

## IV. Cross-Sub-Session Discoveries

{Insights visible ONLY when sub-session results are compared against each other. Emergent patterns, unexpected connections between 30Aa and 30Ba that neither sub-session synthesis captures alone.}

---

## V. Forward Projection

{Priority-ordered next steps. Specific computations. Which new gates are now defined.}

---

## VI. Probability Assessment

{If applicable: prior → posterior arc across the covered sub-sessions.}
```

## Rules
- This is a DEFINITIVE STANDALONE RECORD for one session number. A reader with no prior context should understand the full session arc from sub-session A through the last sub-session.
- Organize by IMPORTANCE, not chronology. A reader should hit the most consequential result first.
- Cross-sub-session discoveries (Section IV) are your highest-value contribution — patterns no individual sub-session synthesis captures.
- Write ONLY the output file. Nothing else.
```

---

### WORKSHOP MODE (Iterative 2-Agent Cross-Pollination)

Workshop mode spawns exactly 2 agents **sequentially** — NO team infrastructure. Each agent runs as a background Agent call, reads the running document, appends their contribution, and completes before the next agent spawns. This loops for `--rounds` rounds (default: 2), producing `rounds * 2` total turns.

**Why no team infrastructure**: The 2-Agent Workshop Pattern (discovered Session 34, Nazarewicz x Tesla) eliminates every team management bug: no inbox routing, no notification avalanche, no shutdown resistance, no stale teams. Pure sequential Agent calls with append-only writes to a single document.

**Short name mapping** — derive from agent type (same table as team mode):

| Agent Type | Short Name |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| baptista-spacetime-analyst | baptista |
| berry-geometric-phase-theorist | berry |
| connes-ncg-theorist | connes |
| coordinator | coordinator |
| cosmic-web-theorist | cosmic-web |
| dirac-antimatter-theorist | dirac |
| einstein-theorist | einstein |
| feynman-theorist | feynman |
| gen-physicist | gen-physicist |
| hawking-theorist | hawking |
| kaluza-klein-theorist | kk |
| landau-condensed-matter-theorist | landau |
| little-red-dots-jwst-analyst | little-red-dots |
| nazarewicz-nuclear-structure-theorist | nazarewicz |
| neutrino-detection-specialist | neutrino |
| paasch-mass-quantization-analyst | paasch |
| phonon-exflation-sim | phonon-sim |
| quantum-acoustics-theorist | quantum-acoustics |
| sagan-empiricist | sagan |
| schwarzschild-penrose-geometer | sp |
| spectral-geometer | spectral-geometer |
| tesla-resonance | tesla |

#### Phase 3W-1: Write Document Header

The team lead (you) creates the workshop document with the header using the Write tool:

```markdown
# Session {session-id} Workshop: {Agent-A-Short} x {Agent-B-Short}

**Date**: {today}
**Format**: Iterative 2-agent workshop ({N} rounds, {N*2} turns)
**Agents**: {agent-a-short} ({agent-a-type}), {agent-b-short} ({agent-b-type})
**Source Documents**:
{bulleted list of source doc paths}

---
```

#### Phase 3W-2: Round Loop

For each round `r` from 1 to `--rounds`:

##### Turn A: Agent A Opens / Follows Up

Spawn Agent A as a background agent using the Agent tool:
- `subagent_type`: first agent from `--agents`
- `run_in_background`: true
- `name`: `workshop-{agent-a-short}-r{r}`

**Round 1 Turn A Prompt:**

```
You are writing the OPENING ANALYSIS for a 2-agent iterative workshop on the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project.

## Source Documents (read ALL of these FIRST)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)
- MEMORY.md: `~\.claude\projects\C--sandbox-rclab-exflation\memory\MEMORY.md`

## Your Task

Read all source documents, then APPEND your analysis to: `{output_path}`

The file already has a header. Read the file first, then use the Edit tool to append after the existing content. Do NOT overwrite the header.

Append a section starting with exactly this heading:

## Round 1 — {agent-a-short}: Opening Analysis

Then write your analysis from your specialist perspective. Structure your analysis with LABELED SECTIONS using your initial (e.g., A1, A2, A3...) so your partner ({agent-b-short}) can reference them precisely. For each section:

- State your key finding or observation clearly
- Connect to your research papers (cite specific equations, results, paper numbers)
- Identify structural implications for the framework
- Where relevant, pose specific questions for {agent-b-short} to address from their domain

## Rules
- APPEND to the file. Do NOT overwrite the header or any prior content.
- Ground in source docs and your research papers. Cite precisely.
- Label sections clearly (A1, A2, A3...) — this is load-bearing for cross-reference.
- Write ONLY to the output file. Do not create any other files.
```

**Round 2+ Turn A Prompt:**

```
You are writing ROUND {r} FOLLOW-UP for a 2-agent iterative workshop on the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project.

## Workshop Document (read this FIRST — it contains ALL prior rounds)
`{output_path}`

## Source Documents (for reference if needed)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)

## Your Task

Read the full workshop document (all prior rounds), then APPEND your Round {r} follow-up to: `{output_path}`

Read the file first, then use the Edit tool to append after the existing content. Do NOT overwrite anything.

Append a section starting with exactly this heading:

## Round {r} — {agent-a-short}: Follow-up

Address {agent-b-short}'s responses to your prior sections. For each of their labeled points:

### CONVERGENCE
Where you now agree with {agent-b-short}'s corrections or extensions — state what changed your assessment and what you both now hold.

### DISSENT
Where you still disagree — defend with new evidence, sharper argument, or quantitative counter. Do not simply restate your prior position.

### EMERGENCE
New insights triggered by the cross-pollination — ideas neither of you had before the exchange that emerge from combining both perspectives.

### QUESTIONS
Sharper follow-up questions based on what you've learned from {agent-b-short}'s analysis.

## Rules
- APPEND only. Do NOT overwrite prior content.
- Reference {agent-b-short}'s prior sections by their labels (e.g., "Re: T3...").
- Every claim must cite source docs or research papers.
- Write ONLY to the output file.
```

**Wait for Agent A to complete before proceeding to Turn B.**

##### Turn B: Agent B Responds / Synthesizes

Spawn Agent B as a background agent:
- `subagent_type`: second agent from `--agents`
- `run_in_background`: true
- `name`: `workshop-{agent-b-short}-r{r}`

**Round 1 Turn B Prompt:**

```
You are writing the RESPONSE for a 2-agent iterative workshop on the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project.

## Source Documents (read ALL of these FIRST)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Workshop Document (read this AFTER source docs)
`{output_path}`

This file contains the header and your partner {agent-a-short}'s opening analysis with labeled sections (A1, A2, A3...).

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)
- MEMORY.md: `~\.claude\projects\C--sandbox-rclab-exflation\memory\MEMORY.md`

## Your Task

Read all source documents AND the workshop document, then APPEND your response to: `{output_path}`

Read the file first, then use the Edit tool to append after the existing content. Do NOT overwrite anything.

Append a section starting with exactly this heading:

## Round 1 — {agent-b-short}: Response & Cross-Synthesis

Structure your response in TWO parts:

### Part 1: Response to {agent-a-short}'s Sections

For EACH of {agent-a-short}'s labeled sections (A1, A2, A3...), write a response labeled "Re: A1", "Re: A2", etc.:

- **Where you AGREE**: State why, add your domain's supporting evidence
- **Where you DISAGREE**: State why with specific reasoning and counter-evidence from your research papers
- **What they MISSED**: Findings your domain reveals that theirs doesn't
- **What EMERGES**: Cross-domain insights visible only from combining both perspectives

### Part 2: Original Analysis

Add your own labeled sections (T1, T2, T3... or B1, B2... — use your initial) covering findings from the source documents that {agent-a-short} did not address. These are sections you want {agent-a-short} to respond to in the next round.

## Rules
- APPEND to the file. Do NOT overwrite anything.
- Reference {agent-a-short}'s sections by label (e.g., "Re: A3...").
- Ground in source docs and your research papers. Cite precisely.
- Write ONLY to the output file.
```

**Round 2+ Turn B Prompt:**

```
You are writing ROUND {r} RESPONSE for a 2-agent iterative workshop on the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project.

## Workshop Document (read this FIRST — it contains ALL prior rounds)
`{output_path}`

## Source Documents (for reference if needed)
{numbered list of all source doc paths}

## Also Read
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md` (if it exists)

## Your Task

Read the full workshop document, then APPEND your Round {r} response to: `{output_path}`

Read the file first, then use the Edit tool to append after the existing content. Do NOT overwrite anything.

Append a section starting with exactly this heading:

## Round {r} — {agent-b-short}: Cross-Synthesis

Address {agent-a-short}'s Round {r} follow-up. Apply the same structure:

### CONVERGENCE
Where you accept {agent-a-short}'s follow-up corrections or new evidence.

### DISSENT
Where disagreement persists — sharpen, don't repeat.

### EMERGENCE
New cross-domain insights from this round's exchange.

{FINAL_ROUND_BLOCK}

## Rules
- APPEND only. Do NOT overwrite prior content.
- Reference prior sections by label.
- Write ONLY to the output file.
```

**FINAL_ROUND_BLOCK** (inserted ONLY when `r == --rounds`, i.e., the last round):

```
### CONVERGENCE TABLE

After your analysis sections, append a verdict table summarizing the full workshop exchange:

## Workshop Verdict

| Topic | Source | Status | Key Insight |
|:------|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| {topic from A1} | {agent-a-short} A1, {agent-b-short} Re:A1 | Converged / Dissent / Partial | {1-line summary} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Status categories:
- **Converged**: Both agents agree after exchange
- **Dissent**: Disagreement persists with both sides' best arguments stated
- **Partial**: Agreement on structure, disagreement on specifics
- **Emerged**: New finding that neither agent held before the exchange

Then add:

## Remaining Open Questions

{Numbered list of questions that the workshop identified but did not resolve. Each should be specific enough to become a computation or a future session topic.}
```

**Wait for Agent B to complete before proceeding to the next round.**

#### Phase 3W-3: Inter-Round Status

After each complete round (both Turn A and Turn B), report to the user:

```
=== WORKSHOP ROUND {r}/{N} COMPLETE ===

{agent-a-short}: {line count of their contribution}
{agent-b-short}: {line count of their contribution}

Document: {output_path} ({total lines} lines)
{If r < N: "Proceeding to Round {r+1}..."}
{If r == N: "Final round complete. Workshop finished."}
```

**Do NOT ask the user for permission between rounds** — the round count was pre-committed via `--rounds`. Proceed automatically.

---

### TEAM MODE

Team mode uses the blast-first workflow from CLAUDE.md. The procedure mirrors `/collab-team` panel mode with synthesis-specific templates.

#### Phase 3T-0: Pre-Flight

1. FOLLOW `team-lead-behavior.md` (project root). Non-negotiable on all items.
2. Read `~\.claude\projects\C--sandbox-rclab-exflation\memory\team-lessons.md` completely.
3. Check `~/.claude/teams/` for stale teams. Report and clean up if found.
4. Verify no active team in this session.

#### Phase 3T-1: Create Team

**TeamCreate** with name: `synthesis-{session-id}` (or `synthesis-{timestamp}` if no session ID).

#### Phase 3T-2: Create Tasks

**For `team` type** (2-3 agents):
- One task per specialist: "Analyze source documents from {domain} perspective, send key findings and assessment to {writer-name}."
- One writer task: "Synthesize specialist perspectives into {output_path}."

**For `fusion` type** (3 agents, multi-round — source docs are themselves syntheses):
- One task per specialist: "Read all source syntheses. Round 1: Identify cross-synthesis patterns your domain uniquely reveals. Round 2: Respond to other specialists' cross-synthesis insights. Round 3: Send final assessment to {writer-name}."
- One writer task: "Collect all specialist inputs across rounds. Write fusion synthesis (synthesis-of-syntheses) to {output_path}. Focus on XS-N cross-synthesis discoveries — findings visible ONLY when comparing source syntheses."

#### Phase 3T-3: Spawn Agents (Blast-First)

Spawn ALL agents with the hard-stop prompt (identical to collab-team):

```
You are a teammate on team "{team-name}". Your name is "{short-name}".

YOUR ONLY ACTION RIGHT NOW: Send a message to "team-lead" saying "ready" using SendMessage. Then STOP. Do absolutely nothing else.

DO NOT:
- Read any files
- Check TaskList
- Read your agent memory
- Read team config
- Start any work

JUST send the ready message and go idle. You will receive a roster blast and your full assignment AFTER all agents have checked in.
```

Spawn ALL in parallel. Wait for ALL to send "ready". Max 3 agents.

#### Phase 3T-4: Roster Blast

Execute `/team-blast --list`. Fallback: manual roster via SendMessage to each agent.

#### Phase 3T-5: Assign Work

After roster blast, send each agent their full assignment via SendMessage.

**Specialist agents** (non-writers):

```
## Your Assignment: {session-id} Synthesis

### Required Reading (MANDATORY, FULL — do these FIRST)
{numbered list of ALL source documents}

Also read:
- Your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md`

### Your Role
Analyze the source documents through YOUR specialist lens. Identify:
- What your domain reveals that generalists miss
- Connections to your research papers (cite specific equations/results)
- Where you agree/disagree with other specialists
- Structural implications for the framework

### Communication
- Send your analysis to {writer-name} via SendMessage.
- Message other specialists for cross-pollination (use NAMES: {name list}).
- {For fusion type: "This is a multi-round deliberation. Round 1: send initial insights. Round 2: respond to others' insights. Round 3: send final assessment."}

### Rules
- Ground in YOUR research papers and the SOURCE DOCUMENTS. Do not invent.
- Be specific: cite equation numbers, gate IDs, computation results.
- Check inbox between sections of analysis.
- When done: TaskUpdate completed + final assessment to {writer-name}.
```

**Designated writer**:

```
## Your Assignment: {session-id} Synthesis Writer

### Required Reading
{numbered list of ALL source documents}

### Your Role: Synthesis Writer
Collect specialist perspectives. Write the synthesis document.

### Output
Write to: `{output_path}`

{INCLUDE THE FULL DOCUMENT STRUCTURE TEMPLATE HERE — use the appropriate template based on --type:}

{For `team` type: use Team Synthesis Template (below)}
{For `fusion` type: use Fusion Synthesis Template (below)}

### Rules
- YOU are the only agent who writes the output file.
- Wait for specialist inputs before writing — do not front-run.
- Capture convergent AND divergent views.
- Attribute insights to their source specialist.
- When done: TaskUpdate completed + send summary to team-lead.
```

**Team Synthesis Template** (for `team` type):

```markdown
# {Title} Team Synthesis: {Subtitle}

**Team**: {agent names and types}
**Designated Writer**: {writer name}
**Date**: {today}
**Re**: {session-id} Results
**Source Documents**: {list}

---

## I. Executive Summary
{2-3 paragraphs: what the team found, where they converge, where they diverge}

---

## II. Convergent Themes
{Themes that multiple specialists agree on. State convergence count.}

### Theme 1: {Title} ({N}/{total} {Unanimous/Majority})
- **{Agent1}**: {their perspective}
- **{Agent2}**: {their perspective}
**Synthesis**: {integrated assessment}

---

## III. Divergent Assessments
{Where specialists disagree. State each side's reasoning.}

---

## IV. Cross-Pollination Discoveries
{Ideas that emerged from discussion — present in the exchange but not in any individual source doc.}

---

## V. Forward Projection
{Priority-ordered next steps synthesized from all specialist inputs.}
```

**Fusion Synthesis Template** (for `fusion` type — synthesis of syntheses):

```markdown
# Session {session-id} Fusion Synthesis

## Synthesis of Syntheses: Cross-Document Deliberation

**Date**: {today}
**Fusion Team**: {agent names and types}
**Designated Writer**: {writer name}
**Method**: {N} rounds of structured cross-synthesis deliberation
**Source Syntheses**: {list — these are themselves synthesis documents, not raw data}
**Fusion Purpose**: Extract patterns, connections, and discoveries visible ONLY when comparing source syntheses against each other

---

## I. The Central Structural Insight
{The ONE deepest finding that emerges from cross-synthesis. 2-3 paragraphs.}

---

## II. Cross-Synthesis Discoveries
{Findings visible ONLY when all source docs are compared. Label each:}

### XS-1. {Discovery Title}
{Description. Attribution: which specialists identified which aspects.}

---

## III. Results Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Framework-Decisive
{Results that change status or direction}

### Tier 2: Structural / Permanent
{Mathematical results surviving any future closure}

### Tier 3: Diagnostic / Informational
{Useful context for future sessions}

---

## IV. Constraint Map Update
{What opened, closed, shifted. Full gate verdict table if applicable.}

---

## V. Forward Projection
{Priority-ordered next computations/sessions. Include specific gate definitions.}

---

## VI. Probability Assessment
{If applicable. Prior → posterior.}

---

## VII. Attribution Index
{Who contributed what. Specialist → their key insight.}
```

Use **TaskUpdate** to set `owner` on each task.

#### Phase 3T-6: Hands Off

Same rules as `/collab-team`:

1. Do NOT send follow-up messages unless an agent explicitly asks for help.
2. Do NOT write the output file — the writer agent does.
3. Do NOT mark agent tasks completed — they mark their own.
4. Do NOT nudge idle agents.
5. Do NOT initiate shutdown — only the USER decides.

**What you MAY do:**
- Respond to agent questions.
- Relay completion summaries to the user.
- If agents disagree on a factual matter in the source docs, send ONE resolution to BOTH.

---

## Phase 4: Verify & Report

### Solo Mode

When the agent completes:

1. Verify output file exists
2. Read it, extract line count
3. Check it contains the mandatory sections for its type

```
=== COLLAB-SYNTHESIS COMPLETE ===

Mode: solo
Type: {type}
Agent: {agent-type}

Output: {path} ({lines} lines)
Source documents: {N}
```

### Workshop Mode

When all rounds complete:

1. Read the final document
2. Count total lines and per-agent contributions
3. Verify the document contains all expected round headings
4. If final round: verify Workshop Verdict table exists

```
=== COLLAB-SYNTHESIS COMPLETE (WORKSHOP) ===

Type: workshop
Rounds: {N} ({N*2} turns)
Agent A: {agent-a-short} ({agent-a-type})
Agent B: {agent-b-short} ({agent-b-type})

Per-Agent Contributions:
  {agent-a-short}: {N} sections across {N} rounds
  {agent-b-short}: {N} sections across {N} rounds

Convergence Summary:
  Converged: {count from verdict table}
  Dissent:   {count}
  Partial:   {count}
  Emerged:   {count}

Output: {path} ({lines} lines)
Source documents: {N}
```

### Team Mode

When the writer reports synthesis complete:

```
=== COLLAB-SYNTHESIS COMPLETE ===

Mode: team
Type: {type}
Team: {team-name} ({N} agents)

Agents:
  {name} .... analysis delivered
  {writer} .. synthesis written

Output: {path} ({lines} lines)
Source documents: {N}
```

**Do NOT initiate shutdown after reporting.** The user decides.

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never overwrite existing files** without user confirmation (Phase 1 collision check).
2. **Never execute computations** — synthesis documents only.
3. **Never modify MEMORY.md**, agent memory, or the knowledge index. Read only.
4. **Never re-adjudicate gate verdicts** — source doc verdicts are authoritative.
5. **Solo mode: never spawn teams.** Team mode: max 3 agents. **Workshop mode: exactly 2 agents, no team infrastructure.**
6. **Always include coordinator in team mode** if not already in `--agents`. **Do NOT add coordinator in workshop mode.**
7. **Never initiate shutdown** — user decides. (Exception: none. This is non-negotiable.)
8. **Team mode follows blast-first workflow** — no exceptions.
9. **Workshop mode is purely sequential** — never spawn Agent B before Agent A completes within a turn. Never spawn the next round before the current round completes.
10. **Workshop header is written by team lead** — agents only APPEND. If an agent overwrites the file, the workshop is corrupted. Prompts emphasize "read first, then Edit to append."
