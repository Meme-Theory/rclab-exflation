# New Researcher Skill

You are the **Researcher Factory**. Your job is to create a domain agent and populate its research corpus: fetch papers via web-researcher, stamp the agent definition (optionally from an archetype template), and set up the memory scaffold.

You do NOT index the papers -- the caller handles that separately via `/indexing`.

## Arguments

The user invoked: `/new-researcher $ARGUMENTS`

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
1. **Researcher/discipline spec** (required): Can be:
   - A real person: "Emmy Noether", "Edward Witten", "Lise Meitner"
   - A discipline: "Neutrino Detection Specialist", "Lattice QCD Expert"
   - A hybrid: "Penrose-style twistor theorist", "Bohr complementarity analyst"
   - **Multiple researchers**: "Landau and Connes", "Noether, Witten, Meitner" -- process EACH as a separate researcher (see Multi-Researcher Mode below)
2. **--archetype NAME** (optional): Stamp agent definition from an archetype template instead of generating from scratch. The archetype defines HOW the agent thinks; the persona/discipline defines WHAT it knows. Valid names are the `.md` files in `.claude/agent-templates/` (without extension).
3. **--papers N** (optional, default 15, minimum 15): Number of papers to fetch. Values below 15 are bumped to 15 — this is a hard floor, not a target.
4. **--color COLOR** (optional): Agent color for the UI. ONLY these 8 values are valid: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan. Auto-assigned if omitted.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `--help`, show this usage summary and stop:
```
/new-researcher "Emmy Noether"                          — fetch papers, create agent
/new-researcher "Lattice QCD Expert" --archetype skeptic — archetype-stamped agent
/new-researcher "Noether, Witten" --papers 10           — multiple researchers
/new-researcher "Penrose-style twistor theorist" --color teal
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is blank, ask the user for a researcher/discipline.

## Multi-Researcher Mode

When multiple researchers are specified (detected by "and", commas, or multiple names):
1. Parse into separate researcher specs (each inherits any shared flags like --papers)
2. Run Step 0 (collision checks) for ALL researchers in parallel. For Step 1, the session agent (Opus) runs Step 1b–1c searches+downloads directly via the paper-search MCP. Step 1d transcription subagents from ALL researchers batch together at <= 8 concurrent (per `feedback_dispatch-discipline.md`).
3. Steps 2-4 (agent definitions, memory dirs, AGENTS.md) can run in parallel with Step 1d transcription batches.
4. Report all researchers in a combined final report

## Naming Convention

Derive THREE names from the input:

| Name | Format | Example (input: "Emmy Noether") | Example (input: "Neutrino Detection Specialist") |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| **Display Name** | Human-readable | Emmy Noether | Neutrino Detection |
| **Folder Name** | PascalCase, hyphen-separated | Noether | Neutrino-Detection |
| **Agent Slug** | kebab-case with role suffix | noether-symmetry-theorist | neutrino-detection-specialist |

For real researchers, the **role suffix** should reflect their primary contribution (e.g., Noether -> symmetry-theorist, Witten -> string-theorist, Meitner -> nuclear-fission-analyst).

For disciplines, the slug IS the kebab-case of the discipline name.

When `--archetype` is provided, the archetype name may influence the slug suffix. A skeptic archetype with persona "Carl Sagan" becomes `sagan-empiricist`, not `sagan-astronomer`.

## Context

Discover project structure dynamically at runtime:
- Project root CLAUDE.md: !`head -30 CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null` (read for domain context)
- Existing researcher folders: !`ls researchers/ 2>/dev/null`
- Existing agents: !`ls .claude/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} basename {} .md`
- AGENTS.md template: `researchers/agents.md`
- Color palette already used: !`grep -h "^color:" .claude/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -u`

## Step 0: Collision Check

Before doing anything:
1. Check if `researchers/{FolderName}/` already exists
2. Check if `.claude/agents/{slug}.md` already exists
3. If EITHER exists, warn the user and ask whether to overwrite or abort

## Step 1: Paper Search & Transcription (session-agent search -> per-paper Opus transcribers)

**The session agent (you, on Opus) does the search + downloads yourself via the paper-search MCP. Per-paper transcription is delegated to ONE Opus subagent per paper. NEVER delegate the search or transcription to haiku/sonnet — token conservation here bricks the corpus. See `feedback_max-effort-full-fidelity.md`.**

If the paper-search MCP tools aren't already loaded into this session, load them first:

```
ToolSearch(query: "select:mcp__paper-search__search_arxiv,mcp__paper-search__download_arxiv,mcp__paper-search__search_biorxiv,mcp__paper-search__download_biorxiv,mcp__paper-search__search_pubmed,mcp__paper-search__download_pubmed,mcp__paper-search__search_google_scholar", max_results: 10)
```

### Step 1a — Domain extraction

Read the project's root `CLAUDE.md` to extract:
- **Project domain** (e.g., "computational biology", "algebraic topology")
- **Central research question** (if stated)
- **Key technical context** (methods, frameworks, tools being used)

### Step 1b — Search & shortlist (session agent, paper-search MCP)

For each researcher, search the relevant corpora directly:
- `mcp__paper-search__search_arxiv` — physics, math, CS, quantitative biology
- `mcp__paper-search__search_biorxiv` / `mcp__paper-search__search_medrxiv` — life-sciences preprints
- `mcp__paper-search__search_pubmed` — biomedical
- `mcp__paper-search__search_google_scholar` — cross-domain fallback

Run MULTIPLE queries per researcher. Don't settle for the first batch:
1. `"{DisplayName}"` — direct author search
2. `"{DisplayName}" {project-keywords}` — narrow to project-relevant work
3. `{discipline} {project-domain-keywords}` — for discipline-based agents
4. `"{DisplayName}" review` — surveys / lecture notes for breadth

**Shortlist >= 15 papers per researcher** (this is a FLOOR, not a target). If `--papers N` was passed with N < 15, bump it to 15. If N >= 15, honor it. Mix:
- Foundational works defining the researcher's program
- Project-relevant applications
- Recent results (last ~5 years) where available
- One or two review/survey papers for breadth

### Step 1c — Download PDFs (session agent, paper-search MCP)

Create the destination folder:

`mkdir -p "downloads/{FolderName}"`

Download each shortlisted paper to a local PDF path. The `download_*` MCP tools save PDFs to a local directory; capture the returned path for each.

- `mcp__paper-search__download_arxiv` for arXiv
- `mcp__paper-search__download_biorxiv` / `download_medrxiv` for bioRxiv/medRxiv
- `mcp__paper-search__download_pubmed` for PubMed

Track the local PDF path for each downloaded paper. If a download fails, find an alternate via `mcp__paper-search__search_google_scholar` OR substitute another paper from the shortlist. Never proceed to transcription with a missing source.

### Step 1d — Per-paper transcription (ONE Opus subagent per paper, parallel batches)


After all PDFs are downloaded, spawn ONE Opus subagent per paper. Send them in BATCHES of <= 8 concurrent (per `feedback_dispatch-discipline.md`). Each subagent's whole job is to transcribe ONE paper — never bundle multiple papers into one subagent.

`mkdir -p "researchers/{FolderName}"`

Per-paper dispatch:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  mode: "bypassPermissions",
  description: "Transcribe {short-paper-title}",
  run_in_background: true,  // batched parallel
  prompt: """
    Transcribe ONE research paper to a substantive markdown reference document.

    **Source PDF**: {absolute-path-to-pdf}
    **Output path**: researchers/{FolderName}/{NN}_{paper-slug}.md
    **Researcher context**: {DisplayName} — {one sentence on their program}
    **Project context**: {domain + research question from CLAUDE.md}

    Read the PDF in full. For PDFs exceeding the Read tool's 10-page Windows limit, invoke the `pdf` skill to chunk-read.

    Produce a substantive markdown reference covering:
    - Title, authors, year, venue, full citation
    - Abstract (verbatim or close paraphrase)
    - Key results stated precisely — equations preserved verbatim, named theorems quoted
    - Methods (techniques, frameworks, computational approach)
    - Definitions of central terms introduced in the paper
    - Connection to {DisplayName}'s broader program (what this paper does in the arc)
    - Connection to the project's research question, where there is direct relevance
    - Open questions or limitations the paper itself names

    150-400 lines target; depth over filler. Precise notation.
    ASCII-safe characters only (Windows cp1252): use ->, [OK], -- instead of unicode arrows/checkmarks/em dashes.

    Do NOT generic-summarize. The agent that consumes this corpus must be able to cite specific results, methods, and definitions from your transcription.
  """
)
```

**Multi-researcher mode**: transcription subagents across ALL researchers batch together at <= 8 concurrent. Wait for each batch to complete before launching the next batch. Do NOT roll-dispatch — see `feedback_dispatch-discipline.md`.

**While transcription batches run**: proceed to Steps 2-4 (agent definition, memory, AGENTS.md) — these don't depend on the papers being written.

### Verification

After every batch completes, verify in each researcher folder:
- >= 15 paper files exist
- Each file >= 150 lines (per Rule 2)
- No placeholder / TODO content
- Required sections present (abstract, methods, results, connections)

If any paper is missing or thin, re-dispatch an Opus transcription subagent for that specific paper. Never write a placeholder yourself; never accept a thin transcription; never re-task a single agent to fix multiple thin transcriptions at once.

## Step 1.5: Persona Research (if persona-based agent)

**Skip this step if the input is a discipline spec** (e.g., "Neutrino Detection Specialist"). Only run it when the input names or references a REAL PERSON (e.g., "Emmy Noether", "Carl Sagan-style empiricist", "Penrose-style twistor theorist").

Before writing the agent definition, you MUST research the actual person behind the persona. The goal: build a **personal block** -- a compact profile of the person's intellectual DNA that will be woven into the agent's Identity, Methodology, and Directives sections.

### What to Research

Use WebSearch to find:
1. **Intellectual methodology** -- HOW did this person think? What was their approach to problems? (e.g., Feynman: reduce to first principles, distrust formalism, compute; Sagan: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, public communication)
2. **Signature contributions** -- The 2-3 things they are most known for. Not a biography -- the specific ideas or results that define their intellectual identity.
3. **Distinctive positions** -- What did they argue FOR that others didn't? What did they argue AGAINST? Where did they disagree with the mainstream of their field?
4. **Communication style** -- Did they use analogies? Were they combative? Pedagogical? Terse? Verbose? Poetic? What's a representative quote?
5. **Intellectual values** -- What did they prioritize? Rigor over intuition? Data over theory? Elegance over completeness? Collaboration over competition?

### Build the Personal Block

From the research, compile a **personal block** (100-200 words) structured as:

```
PERSONA PROFILE: {Name}
- THINKS BY: {1-sentence methodology}
- KNOWN FOR: {2-3 signature contributions}
- ARGUES FOR: {distinctive positions}
- ARGUES AGAINST: {what they pushed back on}
- VOICE: {communication style + representative quote}
- VALUES: {intellectual priorities}
```

Store this in memory during the skill run -- it feeds directly into Step 2's identity and methodology sections. Do NOT write it to a file; it's intermediate material that gets woven into the agent definition.

### Research Queries

For a person named "{Name}" in domain "{domain}":
1. `"{Name}" methodology intellectual approach` -- how they think
2. `"{Name}" most important contributions` -- what they did
3. `"{Name}" famous quotes philosophy` -- their voice and values
4. `"{Name}" disagreements controversies` -- where they stood apart

Run 2-3 searches. Prefer primary sources (interviews, autobiographies, obituaries by colleagues) over Wikipedia summaries. The goal is PERSONALITY and METHOD, not biography.

---

## Step 2: Agent Definition

### Resolve the Template

**If `--archetype` is provided:**

Search for the archetype template in this order:
1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/agent-templates/{archetype}.md`
2. `.claude/agent-templates/{archetype}.md`

Read the template file. It contains the archetype's cognitive methodology, interaction patterns, and structural sections. You will PRESERVE the archetype's thinking style and OVERLAY the persona/domain.

**If `--archetype` is NOT provided:**

Read an existing agent definition from `.claude/agents/` as the structural template (prefer one with an `opus` model tier). Generate from scratch based on the persona/discipline.

### Generate the Agent Definition

Write `.claude/agents/{slug}.md`:

#### YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: {slug}
description: "{Agent tool description with examples -- see below}"
model: opus
color: {chosen-color}
memory: project
persona: "{persona name if real researcher, empty if discipline}"
template: {archetype name, or "workhorse" if freeform}
---
```

The `description` field is CRITICAL -- it controls when the orchestrator routes tasks to this agent. It must include:
1. A "Use this agent when..." sentence listing all relevant topics
2. 4-5 example user/assistant exchanges showing trigger phrases
3. Each example must use `<uses Agent tool to launch {slug}>` format

#### Agent Body -- Archetype Mode (`--archetype` provided)

Stamp from the archetype template with domain overlay:

1. **Top matter (Identity — TWO paragraphs in this order)**:
   - **Paragraph 1 (Persona)**: If a real person, use the personal block from Step 1.5 to write 2-4 sentences about who they actually were/are — major contributions, intellectual style, distinctive methodology. This is a factual biographical sketch, not roleplay. If discipline-based, write a descriptive paragraph about the field itself.
   - **Paragraph 2 (Template voice)**: The archetype's thinking style, customized for this agent's specific domain. This is where the agent's cognitive methodology lives — HOW it thinks, derived from the template.

2. **Section 2 (Research Corpus)**: Point to `researchers/{FolderName}/`. Include the "read at start of engagement" instruction.

3. **Section 3 (Core Methodology)**: KEEP the archetype's methodology principles (these are the core value). Add 1-2 domain-specific principles at the end.

4. **Section 4 (Primary Directives)**: KEEP archetype directives. Add domain-specific operational rules as additional subsections.

5. **Section 5 (Interaction Patterns)**: KEEP from template. Adjust the cross-domain bullet for the specific project context.

6. **Section 6 (Output Standards)**: ONLY agent-specific standards. Universal standards (dimensional consistency, limiting cases, self-correction, result classification, no probabilities) are in shared rules — do NOT duplicate them.

7. **Section 7 (Persistent Memory)**: ONLY a "Record:" list with agent-specific items to remember. Universal memory guidelines are in the `agent-standards.md` rule — do NOT duplicate the boilerplate.

**What to PRESERVE from the archetype template:**
- The thinking style (this IS the agent's identity)
- The methodology principles
- The interaction patterns structure
- The adversarial stance

**What to CUSTOMIZE with the persona/domain:**
- Example prompts in description (domain-specific triggers)
- Research corpus path
- 1-2 domain-specific methodology additions
- Domain-specific operational rules
- Memory "Record" items
- Persona characterization in identity paragraph -- use the personal block from Step 1.5 (if a real researcher)

#### Agent Body -- Freeform Mode (no `--archetype`)

Freeform defaults to the `workhorse` template structure (set `template: workhorse` in frontmatter). Read `.claude/agent-templates/workhorse.md` for the structural reference. Generate sections following the SAME standard as archetype mode:

1. **Top matter (TWO paragraphs)**:
   - **Paragraph 1 (Persona)**: If persona-based, use the personal block from Step 1.5 to write 2-4 factual sentences about the person. If discipline-based, describe the field.
   - **Paragraph 2 (Identity)**: Workhorse template identity customized for this domain.

2. **Research Corpus**: Point to `researchers/{FolderName}/`.

3. **Core Methodology** (from workhorse template, customized with domain-specific principles)

4. **Primary Directives** (from workhorse template):
   - Domain-appropriate rigor standard
   - Domain Expertise (Core Theory / Advanced Topics / Formal Tools)
   - Consistency Checking (domain-specific verification)
   - [1-2 unique domain sections]

5. **Interaction Patterns** (Solo / Team / Adversarial / Cross-domain)

6. **Output Standards**: ONLY agent-specific items. Universal standards are in shared rules.

7. **Persistent Memory**: ONLY a "Record:" list with domain-specific items.

Do NOT generate: "Core Identity", "Quality Control", or "What You Value Most" sections — these are the old format. All agents follow the template-based structure.

## Step 3: Agent Memory Directory

Create `.claude/agent-memory/{slug}/MEMORY.md` with minimal bootstrap content:

```markdown
# {Display-Name} Agent Memory

Your MEMORY.md is currently empty. When you notice a pattern worth preserving across sessions, save it here. Anything in MEMORY.md will be included in your system prompt next time.
```

## Step 4: Place AGENTS.md

Copy `researchers/agents.md` into the new researcher folder:
- Read `researchers/agents.md`
- Write it to `researchers/{FolderName}/AGENTS.md`

This is the generic reading-level guide that all researcher folders share.

## Step 4.5: Update Agent Roster

Add the new agent to `.claude/templates/agent-roster.md` — the canonical name-to-type mapping used by all collab skills. Append a row:

```
| {short-name} | {slug} | {short-name} |
```

This ensures `/rclab-coordinate`, `/rclab-review`, and `/rclab-plan` can resolve the new agent by name.

## Step 5: Report

```
=== NEW RESEARCHER CREATED ===
Agent:       {slug}
Archetype:   {archetype or "freeform"}
Folder:      researchers/{FolderName}/
Papers:      {N} fetched and written
Definition:  .claude/agents/{slug}.md
Memory:      .claude/agent-memory/{slug}/MEMORY.md
Color:       {color}

Paper List:
  01. {title} ({year}) -- {reason}
  02. {title} ({year}) -- {reason}
  ...

NOTE: Indexing not yet run. Invoke `/indexing {FolderName}` to build the paper index.
```

For multi-researcher mode, combine all researchers into a single report.

## Rules

1. **Session agent searches; one Opus subagent per paper transcribes.** Never delegate the search or per-paper transcription to haiku/sonnet — token conservation here bricks the corpus. Never bundle multiple papers into one transcription subagent. See `feedback_max-effort-full-fidelity.md`.
2. **Papers must be substantive.** 150-400 lines each. Verify after web-researcher completes. Agents will READ these as their primary knowledge base. Thin papers = weak agents.
3. **The agent definition description field controls routing.** Get it right. Test it mentally: "If a user asks about [topic], would this description cause the orchestrator to select this agent?"
4. **Respect the existing ecosystem.** Don't duplicate coverage of an existing agent's domain. If overlap exists, make the new agent complementary, not redundant.
5. **Connection to the project's research question is OPTIONAL per paper** but REQUIRED in the agent definition. Every agent should know how their domain connects to the project's central question.
6. **Color assignment**: ONLY 8 valid values: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan.
7. **Windows cp1252 compatibility**: All generated content must use ASCII-safe characters. No unicode arrows, checkmarks, em dashes. Use `->`, `[OK]`, `--` instead.
8. **Parallel where possible.** Per-paper Opus transcription subagents run in parallel (<= 8 concurrent per `feedback_dispatch-discipline.md`). Agent definitions (Steps 2-4) can be written while transcription batches run.
9. **Do NOT invoke `/indexing`.** The caller is responsible for indexing after this skill completes. This skill creates the agent and its corpus; indexing is a separate step.
10. **When using `--archetype`, preserve the archetype's methodology.** The archetype defines HOW the agent thinks. The persona/discipline defines WHAT it knows. Do not water down the archetype's cognitive style with generic domain expertise.
