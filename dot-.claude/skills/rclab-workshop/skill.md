2-agent iterative workshop. Exactly 2 agents, N rounds (default 2, range 1-5), sequential — no team infrastructure. Each agent reads the running document, fills in their sections, and completes before the next spawns.

For solo synthesis (1+ agents independently writing reports from sources), use `/rclab-review`.

## Usage

```
# 2 agents, 2 rounds (default), focus topics
/rclab-workshop session-63*.md --agents hawking,qa --context CC closure, GL stability

# 3 rounds, explicit output
/rclab-workshop session-34*.md --agents kk,connes --rounds 3 --output sessions/session-34/session-34-kk-connes-workshop.md
```

## Phase 0: Parse & Validate

### 0a. Extract Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Arg | Required | Default | Notes |
|:----|:---------|:--------|:------|
| `[doc(s)]` | yes (1+) | — | Source doc paths or globs (positional, before flags) |
| `--agents` | yes | — | Comma-separated agent types or short names. EXACTLY 2. |
| `--session` | no | auto-detect | Session ID (e.g., `63`) |
| `--rounds` | no | `2` | Range: 1-5 |
| `--output` | no | auto-detect | Full output path |
| `--context` | no | — | Focus topics or instructions passed to agents |

### 0b. Validate

1. **Source docs**: Glob-resolve paths. Read 1 line of each to verify existence. Report missing and stop.
2. **Agent types**: Resolve short names via `.claude/templates/agent-roster.md`. If invalid, list available types and stop.
3. **Agent count**: Exactly 2. Anything else: error and stop.
4. **Rounds**: 1-5. Outside range: error and stop.

### 0c. Defaults

**Session ID** (if not provided):
- Extract from first source doc filename: regex `session-(\d+)`

**Output path** (if not provided):
- `sessions/session-{id}/session-{id}-{agentA-short}-{agentB-short}-workshop.md`

If session ID unresolvable, ask the user.

---

## Phase 1: Collision Check

If the output file already exists, ask: "Output file exists at `{path}`. Overwrite / New name / Cancel?"

---

## Phase 2: Execute

Workshop spawns exactly 2 agents **sequentially** — no team infrastructure. Each agent reads the running document, fills in their sections, and completes before the next spawns.

**Short name mapping**: Read `.claude/templates/agent-roster.md`.

### Step 1: Build Full Document Skeleton

**MANDATORY.** Build the COMPLETE workshop skeleton BEFORE launching any agent. Use `.claude/templates/workshop.md` as the structural reference. The skeleton must include:

- Header (date, format, agents, source docs, focus topics)
- ALL round headings for ALL rounds
- ALL turn sections with `*[NOT STARTED]*` placeholders
- Agent A's labeled topic sections (one per focus topic + cross-cutting)
- Agent B's response sections (Re: each of A's sections + original analysis + questions)
- Round 2+ CONVERGENCE / DISSENT / EMERGENCE / QUESTIONS sections
- Workshop Verdict table shell (final round)
- Remaining Open Questions placeholder

Write this skeleton with the Write tool in a single call. Agents fill placeholders using Edit — they never create structure.

### Step 2: Create Task Tracking

```
For each round r and turn (A, B):
  TaskCreate: "R{r}-A: {agent-a-short} analysis" (blockedBy: previous turn)
  TaskCreate: "R{r}-B: {agent-b-short} response" (blockedBy: R{r}-A)
```

### Step 3: Round Loop

For each round `r` from 1 to `--rounds`:

#### Turn A: Agent A

Spawn background agent:
- `subagent_type`: first agent from `--agents`
- `run_in_background`: true
- `name`: `workshop-{agent-a-short}-r{r}`
- `mode`: `acceptEdits`

Mark task `in_progress` before spawn. Mark `completed` after.

**R1 Turn A prompt:**

```
You are writing the OPENING ANALYSIS for a 2-agent iterative workshop on the Phonon-Exflation Cosmology project.

## Source Documents (read ALL of these FIRST)
{numbered list of source doc paths}

Also read your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md`

{If --context:}
## Focus Topics
{context text}

## Your Task

Read all source documents, then FILL IN your sections in: `{output_path}`

The file has a pre-built skeleton with `*[NOT STARTED]*` placeholders. Use the Edit tool to replace each placeholder in the "Round 1 — {agent-a-short}" section with your analysis. Do NOT overwrite the header, other sections, or the Round 2 skeleton.

For each labeled section ({A-initial}1, {A-initial}2, ...):
- State your key finding clearly
- Connect to your research papers (cite equations, paper numbers)
- Identify structural implications for the framework
- Pose specific questions for {agent-b-short}

## Rules
- REPLACE `*[NOT STARTED]*` placeholders in YOUR sections only.
- Ground in source docs and your research papers. Cite precisely.
- Label sections clearly — load-bearing for cross-reference.
- Use substrate language (phononic-framing.md). The fabric is primary; GR is emergent.
- Write ONLY to the workshop file.
```

**R2+ Turn A prompt:**

```
You are writing ROUND {r} FOLLOW-UP for a 2-agent workshop.

## Workshop Document (read FIRST — contains all prior rounds)
`{output_path}`

## Source Documents (reference)
{numbered list}

## Your Task

Read the full workshop document, then FILL IN the Round {r} — {agent-a-short} placeholders:

### CONVERGENCE — Where you now agree with {agent-b-short}. State what changed.
### DISSENT — Where you still disagree. New evidence only; don't restate.
### EMERGENCE — New insights from cross-pollination.
### QUESTIONS — Sharper follow-ups. Answer {agent-b-short}'s questions to you.

## Rules
- REPLACE placeholders in YOUR Round {r} sections only.
- Reference {agent-b-short}'s sections by label.
- Substrate-first framing. The fabric is primary; GR is emergent.
- Write ONLY to the workshop file.
```

**Wait for Agent A to complete before Turn B.**

#### Turn B: Agent B

Spawn background agent:
- `subagent_type`: second agent from `--agents`
- `run_in_background`: true
- `name`: `workshop-{agent-b-short}-r{r}`
- `mode`: `acceptEdits`

**R1 Turn B prompt:**

```
You are writing the RESPONSE for a 2-agent iterative workshop.

## Source Documents (read ALL FIRST)
{numbered list}

## Workshop Document (read AFTER sources)
`{output_path}`

This file contains the header and {agent-a-short}'s opening analysis with labeled sections.

Also read your agent memory: `.claude/agent-memory/{your-type}/MEMORY.md`

## Your Task

Read all source documents AND the workshop document, then FILL IN your sections.

### Part 1: Response to {agent-a-short}'s Sections

For EACH "Re:" placeholder, replace `*[NOT STARTED]*` with:
- **AGREE**: Why, plus your domain's supporting evidence
- **DISAGREE**: Why, with counter-evidence from your papers
- **MISSED**: What your domain reveals that theirs doesn't
- **EMERGES**: Cross-domain insights from combining perspectives

### Part 2: Original Analysis

Fill in your labeled sections ({B-initial}1, {B-initial}2, ...) with findings {agent-a-short} did not address.

## Rules
- REPLACE placeholders in YOUR sections only.
- Reference {agent-a-short}'s sections by label.
- Substrate-first framing.
- Write ONLY to the workshop file.
```

**R2+ Turn B prompt:**

```
You are writing ROUND {r} RESPONSE for a 2-agent workshop.
{If final round: "This is the FINAL TURN — you must also fill the Workshop Verdict table."}

## Workshop Document (read FIRST)
`{output_path}`

## Source Documents (reference)
{numbered list}

## Your Task

Read the full workshop document, then FILL IN the Round {r} — {agent-b-short} placeholders:

### CONVERGENCE — Where you accept {agent-a-short}'s corrections.
### DISSENT — Sharpen, don't repeat.
### EMERGENCE — New cross-domain insights.

{FINAL ROUND ONLY — also fill:}

## Workshop Verdict — Replace the placeholder table. For each topic assign:
- **Converged**: Both agree after exchange
- **Dissent**: Disagreement persists
- **Partial**: Structure agreed, specifics disputed
- **Emerged**: New finding from exchange

## Remaining Open Questions — Numbered list. Each specific enough to become a computation or session topic. Include pre-registered gates.

## Wrap-Up — Workshop Impact Summary (MANDATORY)

Fill this section — it is the PRIMARY output for session planning:

### What Changed
{1-3 bullets: what this workshop CHANGED about the framework's state.}

### What Holds
{1-3 bullets: what SURVIVED the workshop exchange.}

### What Breaks or Strains
{1-3 bullets: what the workshop THREATENS or leaves unresolved. If nothing, "Nothing identified."}

### Carry-Forward Computations (MATH ONLY — propagate to S{N+1})

**Discriminator (4-field test)**: an item belongs HERE iff it satisfies ALL FOUR fields. If ANY field cannot be filled, the item is NOT a math carry-forward — move it to "Effected In-Session" below and EXECUTE it before terminating.

- **What**: specific equation / numerical observable / structural theorem to compute
- **Inputs**: data files, canonical constants, upstream gates needed
- **Gate**: pre-registered PASS / FAIL / INFO threshold with explicit tolerance
- **Effort**: estimated wave-equivalents (compute time)

{Numbered list of items satisfying ALL FOUR fields.}

### Effected In-Session (NON-MATH — MANDATORY, executed by YOU before terminating)

**NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Per CLAUDE.md "No Technical Debt", `feedback_fix-in-session-never-defer.md`, `feedback_no-asking-just-execute.md`, and 50+ sessions of evidence that deferred non-math items become orphans: every non-math item this workshop surfaces MUST be EXECUTED by you NOW with concrete file edits, BEFORE you mark the workshop complete.

You are the final agent (R{r} Turn B). You hold acceptEdits permission on the entire project tree. Use it.

**Non-math classification** (move ANY item matching to this section and EXECUTE):

- Registry edits — status promotions (STAGE-1-CANDIDATE → STAGE-3-PERMANENT; SUGGESTION → MANDATORY at K=3), slot allocations, anchor-structure re-tags (PRIMARY+CONFIRMATION → SOURCE-DOUBLE-CITE-CO-PRIMARY), parse-tree expansion declarations, OP-PROJ/STATE-PROJ suffix retrofits, deferred-pending sub-class tags
- Rule-file extensions — new sub-clauses, K-counter advances, calibration corpus entries, sub-class taxonomy additions
- `methodology-wave-allowlist.md` appends with computed sha256_of_plan_block (plus the registry entry per Edit-discipline item 4 of that rule)
- `canonical_constants.py` promotions via single `update_constant(...)` call (no sub-keying ambiguity)
- knowledge-MCP entity registrations / updates
- Hygiene cleanups — PROVENANCE-dict fixes, missing parse-tree expansions, broken cross-links, stale-pin remediation
- Framework housekeeping — registry index updates, cross-link pointer rows, "see also" references
- Audit-script extensions — regex pattern additions, single-function-scope diagnostic flags

**Procedure**:
1. Enumerate EVERY non-math item surfaced across all rounds (CONVERGENCE / DISSENT / EMERGENCE / QUESTIONS).
2. For each item, EXECUTE the file edit / Write / registry-write NOW.
3. Record the action with concrete file:line reference.
4. Check the box ONLY after the edit is on disk.

**Output format** (one row per non-math item):

- [x] {item} — {action taken} — `{file/path:line-range}` — {sha-short or session anchor}

**FORBIDDEN**:
- Leaving any non-math item UNCHECKED.
- Deferring non-math items to "Carry-Forward Computations".
- Writing "queued for S{N+1}" / "TODO" / "deferred" on a non-math item.
- Asking the orchestrator whether to proceed — proceed and execute.

If you find yourself about to defer a non-math item: STOP. Execute it now. The project has 50+ sessions of evidence this concept has not been applied at the structural layer; you are the fix.

### Closing Line
{One sentence — the single most important thing from this workshop.}

## Rules
- REPLACE placeholders in YOUR sections only WITHIN the workshop document.
- For NON-MATH carry-forwards: you have Edit/Write permission on the project tree. USE IT. Execute the file edits in-session and check off each item.
- Substrate-first framing.
- The Wrap-Up section is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Do not skip it.
- The "Effected In-Session" sub-section is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every non-math item must be checked off with a concrete file edit before you terminate.
- You may write to: the workshop file (your sections), AND any file required to effect a non-math carry-forward (rule files, templates, registries, canonical_constants.py, knowledge MCP).
- You may NOT execute `.py` computation scripts (no compute; that is for next-session math carry-forwards).
```

**Wait for Agent B. Proceed to next round automatically (pre-committed via `--rounds`).**

### Step 4: Inter-Round Status

After each complete round, report:

```
=== WORKSHOP ROUND {r}/{N} COMPLETE ===
{agent-a-short}: {line count}
{agent-b-short}: {line count}
Document: {output_path} ({total lines} lines)
```

Before launching Round 2+, **audit Round 1 for substrate framing violations**. Include specific corrections in the Round 2 agent prompts. Common violations:
- Treating the fabric as embedded IN spacetime (it's the reverse)
- Explaining substrate results via GR (GR emerges from the substrate)
- "Analog of" language (the substrate is fundamental; everything else is derived)
- Particle-physics vocabulary for substrate excitations

---

## Phase 3: Verify & Report

After the final round's Agent B completes, **audit the workshop document for non-math completion compliance BEFORE reporting workshop-complete**:

1. Grep the workshop document for the "Effected In-Session" section header.
2. Count checked items (`- [x]`) and unchecked items (`- [ ]`) inside that section.
3. If ANY item is unchecked, re-dispatch the final agent (`workshop-{agent-b-short}-r{N}-effect-followup`) with a write-only follow-up prompt:

   ```
   The workshop document `{output_path}` has N unchecked non-math items in the "Effected In-Session" section. You have Edit/Write permission on the project tree. Execute each remaining item now (rule-file edit, registry write, canonical_constants.py update, or whatever the item requires), record the file:line action, and tick the box. Do not terminate until every item is checked off. Do not move any item to "Carry-Forward Computations" — that section is MATH ONLY per the 4-field test.
   ```

4. Repeat audit + re-dispatch until all non-math items are checked off (max 3 re-dispatches; if items remain unchecked after 3 attempts, escalate to user with a list of the still-unchecked items).

5. Then report:

```
=== RCLAB-WORKSHOP COMPLETE ===
Rounds: {N} ({N*2} turns)
Agent A: {agent-a-short} ({type})
Agent B: {agent-b-short} ({type})
Convergence: {count} | Partial: {count} | Dissent: {count} | Emerged: {count}
Math carry-forwards (propagate to S{N+1}): {count, all 4-field-complete}
Non-math effected in-session: {count, all checked off}
Output: {path} ({lines} lines)
```

---

## Rules

1. **Never overwrite files** without user confirmation (collision check).
2. **Never execute `.py` computation scripts** — this skill does not run compute. Math/numerical-threshold work is queued as a 4-field carry-forward for the next session. The final agent MAY edit rule files, registries, templates, canonical_constants.py, and other non-`.py`-execution targets to effect non-math carry-forwards.
3. **Never re-adjudicate gate verdicts** — source doc verdicts are authoritative.
4. **Workshop skeleton is MANDATORY** — build ALL sections before ANY agent launches.
5. **Purely sequential** — never spawn B before A completes within a turn.
6. **Substrate-first framing** — audit and correct between rounds.
7. **Effected-In-Session is NON-NEGOTIABLE** — the final round's Agent B (or its follow-up re-dispatch per Phase 3) MUST execute every non-math carry-forward with concrete file edits and tick each box before the workshop terminates. Non-math items deferred to the next session are FORBIDDEN per CLAUDE.md "No Technical Debt" and `feedback_fix-in-session-never-defer.md`. Only items satisfying the math 4-field test (what/inputs/gate/effort) propagate forward.
