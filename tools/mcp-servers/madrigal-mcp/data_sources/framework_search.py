Framework-specific search helpers for retrospective analysis.

These tools encode the project's search criteria for locating existing data
that might retrospectively contain substrate-level pair production signatures
per the Jensen-resonance framework prediction (see
sessions/framework/Phononic-C-Causality.md and
sessions/archive/session-74/session-74-rf-analysis.md).

The helpers layer framework-specific knowledge on top of the generic
MadrigalClient interface: which instruments are phased-array coherent
emitters, which campaigns match the framework's target frequency band,
which experiments explicitly reported anomalies in published literature.

# Framework-specific instrument priority list. Ranked by framework-test value
# per the session-74-rf-analysis.md Section V priority table. Keys are canonical
# short names; values are dicts with instrument code (verified against live
# EISCAT Madrigal query 2026-04-11), Madrigal server short name, and priority
# metadata.
#
# Category layout:
#  (A) Radar instruments — active phased-array or dish emitters
#  (B) Optical coincidence instruments — Fabry-Perots, photometers, all-sky
#      imagers colocated with radars. Critical for framework search because
#      pair-annihilation signatures (511 keV, anomalous spectral lines) would
#      appear in OPTICAL data not in radar returns.
#
# EISCAT Heating facility and EISCAT_3D are NOT in this table because:
#  - EISCAT Heating (Ramfjordmoen) is a facility, not a Madrigal instrument.
#    The 2012 Blagoveshchenskaya X-mode anomaly data lives under whichever ISR
#    observed it — typically EISCAT Tromsø UHF (72) or VHF (74).
#  - EISCAT_3D has NOT achieved first light as of 2026-04. Construction began
#    November 2022; Karesuvanto and Kaiseniemi receiver sites completed
#    September 2023; Skibotn core transmitter status unreported, integrated
#    system not yet producing scientific data, no Madrigal instrument code
#    assigned. (Per Wikipedia EISCAT article, last updated 2026-03-22.) When
#    EISCAT_3D eventually comes online, it will likely be assigned a Madrigal
#    code in the 2000s-8000s range; check periodically with list_instruments.
#
# CRITICAL OPERATIONAL STATUS UPDATE (verified 2026-04-11):
#  - Kiruna UHF antenna (code 71) DEMOLISHED 13 October 2024
#  - Sodankylä UHF antenna (code 73) DEMOLISHED 23 April 2025
#  - Kiruna VHF receiver (code 75) — no new data after Kiruna demolition
#  - Sodankylä VHF receiver (code 76) — no new data after Sodankylä demolition
#  - The legacy EISCAT tristatic UHF system NO LONGER EXISTS as operational
#    hardware. Codes 71, 73, 75, 76 are now purely historical archive targets.
#  - EISCAT Tromsø UHF (72) and Tromsø VHF (74) remain operational at
#    Ramfjordmoen. Tromsø is the sole surviving legacy EISCAT mainland site.
#  - EISCAT Svalbard (95) remains operational at Longyearbyen.
#  - EISCAT Heating facility at Ramfjordmoen remains operational.
